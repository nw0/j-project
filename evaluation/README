  final/ final results used in report
    Full debug output included, +numerical verification
    Note: for acoustic, failed to run np.allclose, BUT:
          counted non-zero & verified np.equal successfully, so
          stronger condition holds.

Naming conventions:
a600k2d4
1st char: t,s,a -- time-tiling, space-tiling, or autotuner run
500,512,600 -- grid size, deduce operator from this
k{1,2,3,...} skewing factor (if time-tiling)
d{2,4,...} space order
